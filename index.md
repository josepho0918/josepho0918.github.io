# About

I am a seasoned firmware engineer passionate about crafting efficient and reliable solutions for embedded systems. My expertise lies in C/C++, ARM Cortex-M, RTOS, and low-level device drivers. I have honed my skills through professional experience at [Baoruh Electronic](http://www.baoruh.com.tw), where I developed and optimized firmware for various embedded applications. I am a continuous learner with a keen interest in new technologies.
